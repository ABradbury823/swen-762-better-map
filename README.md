## Executive Summary

The maps for RIT students to learn how to get around campus are not sufficient, especially when it comes to indoor connections. We aim to fix this problem by creating a better version of RIT maps that includes route generation through tunnels and connected buildings. We also plan to implement extended features to help students find amenities and other places they might want to go on campus. For example, let's say it's freezing cold outside and you are looking for a place to study on the academic side, but don't want to go outside in the cold to get there. On our map, you will be able to search for an open study space and then select a route that gets you there through the tunnels rather than having to brave the outdoors. 


## Requirements

This section describes the features of the application.

### Definition of MVP
The app will act as an improvement for the existing RIT campus
navigation tools. Users will be able to access a campus map to
look up building locations, such as classes/meetings/dorms, and 
navigate to them using the familiar Google Maps API on their
smart phone. Anyone will be able to access the app, such as
vistors on a campus tour, but students will be able to access 
special featuers. Signing in with an RIT ID will allow students
to add favorite locations and view dorm tunnels.

### MVP Features
- As a user, I want to view the map so I can navigate
- As a user, I want to log in with my university ID to access my account info and permissions.
- As an administrator, I want to add/edit routes so that the map remains up to date
- As a student, I want to view tunnel routes so that I can navigate the tunnels
- As a student, I want to favorite locations so that I can easily find my frequented locations
- As a faculty, I want to add availability information
- As a student, I want to see hours of operation so that I know if I have access to areas on campus
- As a student, I want to see accessible facilities such as bathrooms, study rooms, etc. so that I can find places to go
- As a student, I want to add stops to a route so that I can efficiently reach all of my destinations
- As a student, I want to give updates on locations and routes so that others can know about obstacles and closures
